When you would want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you have to work from multiple locations. 
  When you have multiple people who are working on the same project and you have to keep track of everyone.
  When it's necessary to have a backup copy of the commit history.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If sync happens midway while we are working on a feature or bug correction, the uploaded version of files may not function properly and the other people depending on the sync wont benefit from this.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Branches are made when you wish to work on an additional feature and dont want the changes to affect the proper functioning of the master.

	Clone - an operation by which a whole branch of a repository is created in your system which is then made to be in sync with a repository existing in remote. The reverse of this case is also possible.

	A Fork operation is similar to a clone but in this case, the clone and the original - both exist on github itself and the attribution is given to the original creator of the repo and can be traced back.
