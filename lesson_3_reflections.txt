When you would want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you have to work from multiple locations. 
  When you have multiple people who are working on the same project and you have to keep track of everyone.
  When it's necessary to have a backup copy of the commit history.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If sync happens midway while we are working on a feature or bug correction, the uploaded version of files may not function properly and the other people depending on the sync wont benefit from this.
